I am Mohsen and this is why I started my blog  

My name is mohsen. I am originally from Iran and currently living in Stockholm, Sweden. I’m a software and DevOps engineer.  

Most of the time and for my daily projects, I’m using Golang or python as a programming language.
On the DevOps side, I work with docker swarm, Kubernetes, and docker-compose. I’m happy to use helm for managing my Kubernetes applications.  

I made this blog to share my experiences with anyone who may be interested in these domains. I hope that this blog can help others to improve their skills. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback.  

Best regards  
Mohsen Mirzakhani
