My name is mohsen, I’m a software developer and DevOps. most of the time and for my daily projects I'm using Golang or python as a programming language.


On DevOps side I used docker swarm, Kubernetes, and docker-compose and I’m happy with helm to manage my Kubernetes applications.


I made this blog to share my experiences with anyone who may like these things and I hope that this blog can help someone else.
please email me if you have any questions or feedback.

Best

Mohsen Mirzakhani
