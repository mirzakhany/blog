kuberntes is great platform to run and manage applications. but its not always simple.
manay companies try to provide managed kubernetes platforms to make it easy to use and manitain.

[Okteto](https://okteto.com/) is one of them. with Okteto you will have access to a free node with 4 cpu, 8g of ram and 20g of storage
that is perferct to be fimilier with kuberntes. they also provide other plans with different options.

a good part of Okteto is that they have a simple web admin and you will be able to deploy and manage your
applications directly from there without require to install and setup kubectl, that will be of course great if you do.
